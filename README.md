Juggling multiple programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C++, SQL, and Bash can 
be overwhelming. I often find myself diving deep into one language, only to neglect others.
To maintain a balanced learning pace, I created this small program that randomly picks 
which language to focus on each day of the week. This ensures consistent progress across 
all languages. Right now, the list is hard-coded, but I will create a menu for the program soon,
to interactively add your list and see a print-out of what day of the week to study the different
subjects.
