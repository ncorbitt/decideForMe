Juggling multiple programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C++, SQL, and Bash can 
be overwhelming. I often find myself diving deep into one language, only to neglect others.
To maintain a balanced learning pace, I created this small program that randomly picks 
which language to focus on each day of the week. This ensures consistent progress across 
all languages.
